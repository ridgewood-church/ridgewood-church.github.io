<section id="body"><div class="inner"><h2>We are a Church Growing Together</h2>
<p> Ridgewood Church is a Church that is focused on growing community across generations. Thus, there are a few things that may look a little different for guests with previous church experience.  Just know that we at Ridgewood are nothing more than real people, living in a real world, serving a real God.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>No Age-Graded Ministries</h3>
    <p>Believing that all people, from infants to the elderly, benefit from relationships of all ages and that every Christian is a valu&#173;able con&#173;trib&#173;u&#173;tor to the body of Christ, we do not segregate each member of your household to ‘age appropriate’ or 'life stage' classes.  Instead, we all at Ridgewood worship and learn together on the Lord's Day as one big family: the family of God.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Children are Welcome</h3>
    <p>Children are welcome in the worship gathering. In fact, it is encouraged. We believe it is the parent’s duty to train their children to participate in cooperate worship which includes worshipping through song, tithing, prayer, and actively listening as the Word of God is taught. (Deut. 31:12-13; Ezra 10:1; Matt. 18:1-5; 19:13-15; Eph. 6:1-4; Col. 3:20). You may hear cooing babies or small voices during the gathering. These times are a great opportunity to rejoice ‘for to such belongs the Kingdom of God’ (Mark 10:14) and are an opportunity to ‘bear with one another’ (Col 3:13). If at any time you feel that your child might be a distraction to others and needs more of your attention, you are welcome to take them to the nursing moms area in the back of the ladies’ restroom or to the Genesis room at the far end of the hall. Both places have video and audio feed for your convenience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>The Lord’s Supper</h3>
    <p>We conclude each of our services by taking the Lord’s Supper. While we do practice open communion (non-members are welcome), we do ask that the elements only be taken by professing, baptized believers who are in good standing with their local church (Acts 2:43-47; 1 Corinthians 11:23-24).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>The Bible is Our Guide</h3>
    <p>Since we believe that the Bible is God’s word and is our final authority in all matters of faith and practice, we practice systematic exposition in our preaching ministry. Our music is chosen not based upon style or personal preference; rather it is prayerfully selected based upon the text of Scripture that is being expounded during the gathering (Acts 2:42-47; Colossians 3:16).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Fellowship Meal</h3>
    <p>After the service, we invite you to join us for a fellowship meal. The families of Ridgewood have brought food for their own household and extra to share with you. We think worship is about more than just music and preaching. Fellowship is one way we endeavor to ‘encourage one another’ in our Christian walk (Acts 2:42-47; Hebrews 10:24-25).</p>
